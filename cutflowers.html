<p>Cut flowers offer the best combination within horticulture : the growing aspect, and the creativity. </p>
<p>  For this reason, we recently started to rent a 20x30 metres field situated in Duddingston village (Edinburgh), to develop a sustainable cut flowers business.</p> 
<p>A lot of work has to be done to make the soil ready for the first planting in Spring 2015 !  Our field is open to the public, so feel free to pop in and have a chat with us! Also there will be some possibilies to volunteer soon, and help us to build a tool shed, compost tip, and work on the ground to make the soil ready for Spring. </p><p>  So get in touch with us, and we'll keep you up to date ! </p>
