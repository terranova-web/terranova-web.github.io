<div class="aboutus">

<p><strong>ORNA</strong><br> A strong interest in the natural world  led me to train at the Royal Botanic Gardens in Edinburgh and I have gone on to work and train in several gardens since.</p>

<p>
One of these was a year long internship at Cambo gardens in Fife, a naturalistic garden focusing on the principles which have been developed in the New Wave style of perennial planting which came over from Europe. This internship focussed on planting design, the principles of which can be applied to any planting style.</p>
<p>
Shortly after I was funded by the RHS to spend two months in Laos, in their developing botanic gardens studying plant collection management.
</p>
<p>
Prior to starting Terranova I was Head Gardener in a traditional Arts and Crafts garden originally attributed to Gertrude Jekyll in East Lothian.Â  
</p>
<p>
These and other experiences have led to a love of plants, their use in design and the traditional use of cut flowers as a means to link the houseand garden and bring nature in.</p>

<p><strong>JEREMIE </strong><br>
Originally from Paris with a background in the visual arts, on moving to Edinburgh I decided to make my passion my career and re-trained in horticulture.</p>
<p>
Since then I have worked as a self-employed gardener in a variety of different places from large estate gardens right down to tiny balcony retreats!
</p>
<p>
In conjunction with this I worked at award winning nursery Binny Plants, being exposed to thousands of plants has led to a bit of an obsession with hardy perennials.
</p>
<p><strong>TERRANOVA</strong><br>
We envisioned 'Terranova' as a platform from which we could develop and explore our interests in planting design and growing in both a creative and sustainable way.
</p>
<p>
To facilitate this we now lease a field in central Edinburgh.
</p>
<p>
We use this space as our laboratory! 
</p>
<p>Growing organically we focus on plants which make good garden specimens as well as good cut flowers- those that are both tend to be good all round performers!</p>
<p>
The idea of cut flowers was a natural extension of our love of design and propagation: affording the opportunity to design with different forms and colours on a small scale, the resulting arrangement providing a way to link the garden and the home and is a  reminder of seasonality and the natural world.
</p>
<p>
This process feeds right back into our planting design and we hope to develop and specialise further, looking at our native flora and their ornamental potential more closely- both for the garden and the vase!
